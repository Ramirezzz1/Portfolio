            <h3>About me<h3>
            <p class="history-font">I joined the United States Army immediately after graduating highschool in 2014. 
                I went on to served as a 15R "Apache crewchief" for six years. During those six years I 
                went two deloyments, one to Europe from 2016 to 2017 and another to Iraq in 2019 to 2020. After transitioning
                back to civilian life I went to college for a year where I found an interest in computers science and coding.
                During my free time I like to go bar hopping with my friends, I enjoy playing gears of war , and I enjoy physical activities
                such as working out or particpating in 5k races.</p>
